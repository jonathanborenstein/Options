# Options


This program takes the weekly put and call options on a specific stock, and finds the maximum pain for that stock. The maximum pain is the price the stock needs to be at for both the puts and calls together to be worth the least.

For Example, if you run the program and put in AAPL, and the result is 97, that is the price where both put and call options for AAPL will be worth the least.

Running OptionTest.Java is the best way to implement this program at the moment.
